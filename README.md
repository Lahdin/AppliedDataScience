**Instructor Information**

Matthias Haber is working as head of data analytics at Looping Group. Previously, he was a research scientist at the Hertie School of Governance with research interests in party politics, electoral behavior, machine learning, survey experiments, and measurement problems. He holds degrees from the University of Mannheim, the University of Essex, and the University of Potsdam.

### Course Contents and Learning Objectives

As data are increasingly available online, data analysis has replaced data acquisition as the bottleneck to empirical research in the social sciences. 80% of empirical research is spent sourcing, cleaning and preparing often noisy data, while the remaining 20% is actual data analysis. Extracting knowledge from heterogeneous datasets requires not only computational tools, but the programming skills to use them effectively.

This course introduces computational methods needed for data generation, data manipulation, data visualization, and data reproducibility and provides students with the ability to apply them to their own projects. The course is organized in three parts. The first part of the course will introduce ways to effectively extract, load, transform, and visualize structured and unstructured data. The second and third part will focus on practical applications of data science methods in academic research and in the industry respectively.

There is an increasing demand inside and outside of academia for skills to effectively analyze data as well as present results to a range of audiences making this course equally relevant for students seeking scientific or business careers.

The goals of the course are to learn ways to efficiently import, explore and communicate messy data from various sources and to get an overview of current industry data science solutions. 

### Grading and Assignments

The course requires the completion of small, weekly homework exercises and a final data project. Political science thrives of collaboration and co-authorship. Hence, the participants are allowed (but not required) to complete their homework exercises and their final projects in two-person teams. The data project is due in the final exam week.

**1. Weekly Assignments**

Each week students have to complete small homework exercises that allow them to directly apply the techniques they learned in class. Homework exercises contribute 6% to the final grade each and students are encouraged to complete them in pairs.

**2. Final project**

For the final data project students are given a large dataset and will analyze it and present their results using their own ideas and skills learned throughout the course.


**Composition of the Final Grade**

| Name                            | Percent of Final Mark | Due             |
|---------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------|
| Weekly Assignments              | 60%                   | Tuesdays, 8 am  |
| Final Data Project              | 40%                   | May 17, 8 am    |

**Late submission of assignments**

For each day the assignment is turned in late, the grade will be reduced by 10% (e.g. submission two days after the deadline would result in 20% grade deduction).

**Attendance**

Students are expected to be present and prepared for every class session. Active participation during lectures and seminar discussions is essential. If unavoidable circumstances arise which prevent attendance or preparation, the instructor should be advised by email with as much advance notice as possible. Please note that students cannot miss more than two sessions. For further information please consult the Examination Rules §9.

**Academic integrity**

The Hertie School of Governance is committed to the standards of good academic and ethical conduct. Any violation of these standards shall be subject to disciplinary action. Plagiarism, deceitful actions as well as free-riding in group work are not tolerated. See Examination Rules §15.
